            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Residing in India, my professional journey unfolds as a seasoned specialist in Cyber Incident Response, Data Breach Analysis, and Programmatic Extraction. As the dedicated Technical Team Lead at Integreon, my role extends beyond traditional leadership—actively cultivating a culture of continuous improvement, fostering technical brilliance, and orchestrating holistic performance management within the team. My previous role as a Technical Lead at UnitedLex was marked by leadership in diverse projects, where I played a pivotal role in educating teams on cutting-edge data extraction techniques, leveraging tools like Python, Advanced Excel, and Power Query. My hands-on involvement in crafting formula-driven reports using Python showcased my commitment to delivering top-notch outcomes.

Within the realms of UnitedLex, I also assumed roles such as a Senior Associate in the Tech Team, where my expertise in bulk and programmatic extractions, coupled with proficiency in data cleansing and mining techniques, significantly contributed to transforming intricate data sets into comprehensible structures. I delved into statistical analyses, harnessed visualization tools, and consistently proposed innovative approaches to streamline business processes, elevating overall workflow efficiency.

My tenure as an Associate in Data Breach/Incident Response at UnitedLex reflects my integral role in adhering to project protocols, overseeing Data Breach Analysis (DBA) for clients across the US, UK, and other jurisdictions. My expertise in identifying and capturing personal information within electronically stored documents, ensuring stringent adherence to quality standards, and maintaining unwavering confidentiality underscored my commitment to data security.

Beyond UnitedLex, I assumed the mantle of Lead in Audio Annotation & Analytics at Bits and Bytes, where my proficiency in transcriptions, valuable feedback for enhancing machine learning algorithms, and efficient management of administrative duties stood out. Further diversifying my experience, my role as a Data Analyst at PolicyX.com Insurance Web Aggregator Pvt Ltd involved measuring employee performance, contributing to precise data analysis through recorded monitoring, and executing data audits with finesse.

Completing the circle, my academic journey culminated in a Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from ITM University, Gwalior—a solid educational foundation complementing a dynamic and accomplished career journey. My commitment to professional excellence and continuous development resonates through a tapestry of experiences, reflecting adaptability, resilience, and an unwavering pursuit of excellence.
